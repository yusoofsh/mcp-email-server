# Private Email MCP — FastMCP OAuth fork

This fork adds a **single-container remote MCP endpoint with local Argon2id password login**.
No GitHub/Google OAuth app or external identity provider is needed. ChatGPT connects using
OAuth authorization code + PKCE; Basic credentials are accepted only in the protected login
step, never on `/mcp`.

- **Deploy:** [Docker Compose and setup](docs/remote-oauth.md)
- **Image:** `ghcr.io/yusoofsh/mcp-email-server:latest` (AMD64 / ARM64; published after CI passes)
- **CI:** [Remote OAuth CI and GHCR](https://github.com/yusoofsh/mcp-email-server/actions/workflows/remote-ci.yml)
- **Security design:** [Boundaries and limitations](docs/remote-design.md)
- **Tracking:** [Implementation and validation issue #1](https://github.com/yusoofsh/mcp-email-server/issues/1)

The upstream email engine stays unchanged in its SDK-v1 environment. A pinned FastMCP 4
front end proxies it over private stdio in the same non-root container. Separate environments
avoid an unsafe in-place SDK migration. Existing sender/recipient/attachment policies still apply.

An MCP server for reading, searching, organizing, and sending email through
IMAP and SMTP.

> [!NOTE]
> Version 1.0.0 introduces Local Email App V2. Updating the package does not
> automatically import existing settings created with PyPI 0.16.0 and earlier:
> they remain active in backward-compatible `legacy` mode, so there is no required
> migration. If you
> would like to use the new managed storage, you can review and import those
> settings whenever it is convenient.

`mcp-email-server` supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. See
[Security](docs/security.md) for platform-specific filesystem and credential
storage details.

## Optional migration for existing installations

An `@latest` release that includes Local Email App V2 offers a preview-first
CLI migration:

```bash
uvx mcp-email-server@latest config init \
  --database ~/.config/mcp-email-server/managed.sqlite3
uvx mcp-email-server@latest config import-legacy
uvx mcp-email-server@latest config import-legacy --apply
uvx mcp-email-server@latest config doctor
```

The apply step displays the plan again and asks for `IMPORT` confirmation. A
complete import selects managed mode; otherwise the existing legacy settings
remain selected. The source TOML file and its legacy keyring entries are left
untouched. You can also run `uvx mcp-email-server@latest ui` and choose **Import
existing settings**. After a successful import, restart running MCP clients. See
the detailed [upgrade guidance](docs/getting-started.md#upgrading-to-local-email-app-v2)
and [import troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md#legacy-import-reports-a-conflict-or-missing-credential).

## Quick start

### 1. Configure an email account

From this source checkout, run the configuration UI with
[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv sync
uv run mcp-email-server ui
```

For a published release whose notes state that it includes Local Email App V2,
`uvx mcp-email-server@latest ui` is the equivalent temporary invocation.

Keep the foreground command running. On a truly empty installation, the
authenticated browser session prepares private account storage at the safe local
default; existing TOML or environment configuration instead offers an explicit
import review while the previous settings keep running. The account-first UI has
only **Email accounts** and **Settings & help** as primary destinations. Start
with the email address and password; the UI fills common connection settings from
the email domain and keeps them editable, while outgoing mail remains optional.
A saved complete account is ready without a separate activation step. Use
**Password & test** on the saved account if desired, then restart the MCP client
to apply the selected settings.

### 2. Configure the MCP client

Use the same V2-capable distribution for stdio as for the UI. For a published
V2 release, add the following server definition to the MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-email-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-email-server@latest", "stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the MCP client after updating its configuration. When testing this
source checkout before publication, invoke `uv run --directory
/absolute/path/to/mcp-email-server mcp-email-server stdio` instead of pairing a
managed catalog with PyPI `@latest`.

### 3. Verify the connection

Ask the client to list the configured email accounts or recent messages.

## Other configuration methods

For the SQLite-backed managed CLI workflow, Windows and POSIX storage boundaries,
headless environments, multiple accounts, custom TLS settings, and
environment-variable configuration, see the
[documentation](https://mcp-email-server.wh1isper.top/). Release 1.6.2 and later
also publish Linux `amd64`/`arm64` images at
`ghcr.io/wh1isper/mcp-email-server`; see the
[container instructions](https://mcp-email-server.wh1isper.top/getting-started/#run-the-official-container-image).
