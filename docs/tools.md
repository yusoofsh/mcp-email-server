mcp-email-server exposes bounded account discovery, message, mailbox, and
composition operations as MCP tools. Tool schemas are generated from the running server, so the MCP client
can inspect each parameter and response type directly.

## Typical workflow

Most message workflows follow this sequence:

1. Call `list_available_accounts` to select an `account_name`.
2. Call `list_emails_metadata` to search a mailbox and obtain `email_id` values.
3. Pass those IDs to a read or mutation tool with the same mailbox name.
4. Call `get_emails_content` only for messages whose bodies are needed.

This separates lightweight metadata searches from potentially large body
retrievals.

MCP input schemas advertise the enforceable string and collection envelopes from
the centralized application limits, including `maxLength`, `minItems`, and
`maxItems` for account/mailbox names, UID collections, recipients, attachments,
and flags. JSON Schema counts characters while the application limits UTF-8
bytes, so every application service independently revalidates direct and MCP
callers; aggregate recipient and payload limits also remain application-owned.

## Account resource

The resource URI `email://{account_name}` returns the same stable non-secret
capability record used by account discovery. It does not return configuration or
masked credential objects.

## Account tools

### `list_available_accounts`

Lists all enabled accounts from the selected configuration mode as explicit
capability records. Each record contains `account_name`, `account_type`,
`description`, optional `email_address`, `can_receive`, and `can_send`. Account
descriptions are limited to 4 KiB of UTF-8 data and expose the same structural
bound in the output schema. In managed mode, disabled accounts are omitted before any credential lookup or provider
access. Use only an account with `can_receive=true` for mail reads and
`can_send=true` for `send_email` and `forward_email`. Text content, structured
content, and the output schema describe the same fields.

If the result is empty, account setup is unavailable over MCP. The agent should
ask the user to run `mcp-email-server ui` or the documented interactive CLI in
their own terminal and must never request or relay credentials. The output schema
and application boundary allow at most 1,000 accounts; the canonical JSON must
also fit the shared 8 MiB response ceiling. Oversized authority data is rejected
with `limit_exceeded` rather than truncated.

MCP exposes no account, endpoint, policy, catalog, or credential mutation tool in
either mode. Use `mcp-email-server ui` or the user-operated `config` and
`account` CLI commands. This prevents an agent or chat transcript from becoming
a credential handoff surface. The complete tool names, descriptions, input and
output schemas, annotations, resource template, and visibility are static and
covered by an exact catalog contract test.

`add_email_account`, which exists in PyPI 0.16.0 and earlier, is intentionally
absent from Local Email App V2 rather than renamed. See
[Upgrading to Local Email App V2](getting-started.md#upgrading-to-local-email-app-v2)
for client discovery and configuration migration steps.

## Mail mutation permissions

All tools remain in the static catalog; permissions are checked when called and
freshly before independent provider effects. Global `allowed_mutations` defaults
to all five classes for old and new configurations. Account omission/null
inherits; an explicit list replaces; `[]` means read-only.

| Class      | Workflows                                                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `draft`    | `save_draft` with fixed destination resolution and `\Draft` flag               |
| `organize` | mark-read/unread, `set_email_flags`, `set_email_tags`, move and archive        |
| `delete`   | `delete_emails` and its scoped deletion/expunge                                |
| `send`     | `send_email`, `forward_email`, and narrowly their successful-message Sent copy |
| `append`   | `save_to_mailbox` with caller mailbox and flags                                |

`get_emails_content(mark_as_read=true)` also requires `organize`; use the
non-marking read option for a read-only account. Organization cannot perform
unrestricted expunge. Sending does not grant arbitrary APPEND, and draft-only
access does not permit caller-selected mailbox/flags. Recipient, sender,
attachment, account lifecycle, and provider constraints still apply.

## Agent planning annotations

Every tool advertises reviewed MCP `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`,
`idempotentHint`, and `openWorldHint` values:

| Tools                                                                                           | Read-only | Destructive | Idempotent | Open world |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| `list_available_accounts`, `list_allowed_recipients`, `list_allowed_senders`, `list_email_tags` | yes       | no          | yes        | no         |
| `list_emails_metadata`, `list_mailboxes`, `get_attachment_content`                              | yes       | no          | yes        | yes        |
| `get_emails_content`                                                                            | no        | no          | yes        | yes        |
| `send_email`, `forward_email`, `save_draft`, `save_to_mailbox`                                  | no        | no          | no         | yes        |
| `set_email_flags`, `set_email_tags`, `mark_emails_as_read`                                      | no        | no          | yes        | yes        |
| `delete_emails`, `move_emails`, `archive_emails`, `download_attachment`                         | no        | yes         | no         | yes        |

`get_emails_content` is conservatively non-read-only because
`mark_as_read=true` changes remote flags. Download is destructive because the
caller-selected destination may be replaced. Send, forward, and append create
externally meaningful effects but do not delete or replace an existing mailbox
item, so their destructive hint is false while their read-only and idempotent
hints are also false.

Annotations are advisory host/agent planning hints, not authorization or a
safe-retry guarantee. Tool descriptions, current policy, typed outcomes, and the
rule against replay after an ambiguous effect remain authoritative.

## Reading and searching

### `list_emails_metadata`

Searches one mailbox without downloading message bodies.

Important parameters include:

| Parameter                     | Default  | Description                                 |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `account_name`                | Required | Configured account identifier.              |
| `page`                        | `1`      | One-based result page.                      |
| `page_size`                   | `10`     | Number of results per page, from 1 to 100.  |
| `mailbox`                     | `INBOX`  | Mailbox to search.                          |
| `before` / `since`            | None     | Timezone-aware `INTERNALDATE` boundaries.   |
| `subject`                     | None     | Subject filter.                             |
| `from_address` / `to_address` | None     | Address filters.                            |
| `seen`                        | None     | Filter by read status.                      |
| `flagged`                     | None     | Filter by flagged or starred status.        |
| `answered`                    | None     | Filter by replied status.                   |
| `body`                        | None     | Search message bodies with IMAP `BODY`.     |
| `text`                        | None     | Search headers and bodies with IMAP `TEXT`. |
| `has_attachment`              | None     | Apply a multipart attachment heuristic.     |
| `semantic_tags`               | None     | Configured semantic tag names.              |
| `tag_match`                   | `all`    | Require `all` tags or at least `any` tag.   |
| `order`                       | `desc`   | Return ascending or descending results.     |

The response contains pagination metadata, a filtered `total`, and message
metadata including `email_id`, `message_id`, subject, sender, recipients, and
date. `since` is inclusive, `before` is exclusive, and both compare the
provider's IMAP `INTERNALDATE` as an absolute instant. Each value must include a
UTC offset; values with any valid offset are normalized to UTC. Ordering uses the
same `INTERNALDATE` value. The returned `date` remains the message's RFC 5322
`Date` header and can differ from the provider timestamp used for filtering and
ordering. Every message also returns `provider_keywords`, containing all observed
non-system IMAP keywords, and `semantic_tags`, containing the configured semantic
names that map to those keywords. Unknown keywords remain visible in
`provider_keywords`; standard flags remain
separate. To and Cc are parsed as structured RFC 5322 address fields: a comma inside
a quoted display name is preserved, while addresses inside a group are returned
as individual recipient entries. Because this operation fetches headers only,
its `attachments` field is empty. `get_emails_content` populates attachment names
from the full message.

`has_attachment` uses a `multipart/mixed` heuristic. It can miss inline content
or report multipart messages that do not contain a conventional attachment.

When a sender allowlist is configured, blocked messages are removed before
pagination, so `total` and page sizes describe only visible messages.

The application keeps a rebuildable SQLite projection for unfiltered mailbox
pages. It uses that projection only after a small IMAP `STATUS` probe confirms
the same UIDVALIDITY, UIDNEXT, and message count and the projection covers the
whole mailbox. Before returning a cached page, it fetches current FLAGS only for
the UIDs on that page so external tag changes are not hidden by the projection.
Text, date, address, flag, tag, body, and attachment filters remain on the
bounded IMAP path so provider-specific search semantics and mutable flags stay
authoritative. Tag filters resolve configured semantic names before IMAP search
and reject unknown values before provider access. ASCII filter values retain their exact text through IMAP
atom or quoted-string encoding. Non-ASCII filter values use synchronizing UTF-8
literals with `CHARSET UTF-8`; a provider that rejects that charset returns a
bounded search failure rather than receiving malformed raw UTF-8 command text.
Because base IMAP `BEFORE` and `SINCE` ignore the time and timezone components
of `INTERNALDATE`, date criteria are conservative candidate filters. The server
widens them across adjacent calendar dates, fetches complete `INTERNALDATE`
evidence, and reapplies the exact `[since, before)` interval before calculating
`total`, ordering, and pagination. Date criteria always use the protocol's
English month tokens regardless of the server process locale. A response
normally omits `warnings`; if a validated IMAP
result was returned but its rebuildable projection could not be persisted, the
response includes `warnings: ["projection_write_failed"]`. It never includes the
local exception detail.

A refresh stores at most the 1,000 most recent UIDs and claims complete coverage
only when the whole mailbox fits that window and provider state is unchanged
across the refresh. Provider fallback accepts at most 10,000 unique canonical
single UIDs; ranges, sets, zero, duplicates, and values outside the IMAP UID
range are rejected before any UID FETCH. Metadata header requests use IMAP
partial fetches, with limits of 64 KiB per
message and 4 MiB total per metadata query or refresh. Each wire FETCH is also
sized below that aggregate ceiling. Missing, duplicate, or mismatched sender or
INTERNALDATE evidence is a bounded error because the server cannot otherwise
prove the exact total or ordering. Transport and protocol failures are mapped to
bounded categories without returning provider-controlled detail. If a work or
payload ceiling is exceeded,
the tool returns a bounded error instead of an inexact `total`, partial page, or
unbounded projection.

### `get_emails_content`

Fetches the body of one or more messages by `email_id`.

Each returned message includes the same `provider_keywords` and `semantic_tags`
fields as `list_emails_metadata`.

### `list_email_tags`

Returns the semantic tag configuration for one account: `name`, `keyword`,
`description`, and `writable`. Use it to translate natural-language intent into
a configured tag. An omitted `writable` value is reported as `false`.

| Parameter         | Default  | Description                                                     |
| ----------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `account_name`    | Required | Configured account identifier.                                  |
| `email_ids`       | Required | IDs returned by `list_emails_metadata`.                         |
| `mailbox`         | `INBOX`  | Mailbox containing the messages.                                |
| `mark_as_read`    | `false`  | Mark successfully retrieved messages as read.                   |
| `body_offset`     | `0`      | Character offset at which body output starts.                   |
| `max_body_length` | `20000`  | Maximum body characters returned per message, from 1 to 100000. |

If a body extends beyond the requested window, the returned body ends with
`...[TRUNCATED]`. Fetch the next chunk by increasing `body_offset` by
`max_body_length`.

The batch response reports requested and retrieved counts and includes
`failed_ids` for messages that could not be fetched. A full-message literal from
a successful IMAP FETCH is parsed regardless of its byte length; protocol
metadata without a message literal is not treated as content. Each returned
email also includes nullable `in_reply_to` and `references` values from the
corresponding RFC headers. `references` is returned as one decoded, unfolded string with
folding spaces and tabs normalized. Missing and whitespace-only values become
`null`; if an invalid message repeats either header, the parser's first observed
value is returned. This is untrusted observational header data, not a validated
list of Message-IDs. Well-formed values can be passed back to the compose tools,
but malformed values containing other control characters can be returned and
will be rejected by compose validation. These fields are available only from
full-content reads: they are not part of `list_emails_metadata` and are not
persisted in the SQLite metadata projection.

MIME body extraction does not descend into attachment subtrees. In particular,
the body of an attached or forwarded `message/rfc822` message is never merged
into the containing message body, even when that part has no filename. If one
text part declares an unknown charset or contains invalid bytes, it falls back
to UTF-8 replacement decoding without hiding the other readable parts.

A request accepts 1 to 500 canonical positive decimal ASCII IMAP UIDs; zero,
leading zero, non-ASCII digits, signs, ranges, sets, and values above the IMAP UID
limit are rejected before provider access. The provider adapter repeats this
validation before opening an IMAP connection as defense in depth. Raw messages
above 50 MiB are rejected before MIME parsing. The production provider also
counts each returned body's UTF-8 bytes before retaining it and stops immediately
if the batch would exceed the 50 MiB aggregate body budget; the application
validates the aggregate again at its provider boundary. Each returned thread
header is limited to 64 KiB of UTF-8 data and both count toward the 4 MiB
aggregate returned-header budget. The production provider enforces these header
budgets before retaining each parsed result, and the application independently
revalidates them at its provider boundary. Oversized values fail explicitly
rather than being truncated into an invalid thread chain.

When the complete valid batch exceeds the inline MCP response ceiling, the
server writes the canonical JSON response to a randomly named owner-only file in
a process-private temporary directory. The bounded response then has
`content_omitted=true`, an empty `emails` preview, and
`output_file_path`, `output_media_type`, `output_bytes`, `output_sha256`, and
`output_lifetime` fields. A local MCP host can inspect that exact path with its
own filesystem tool. The file is available only until the email-server process
exits; copy needed content before restarting. The server does not add a generic
file-download tool or remote URL. Spill requires the complete POSIX owner/no-follow
profile or the local fixed NTFS Windows DACL/reparse/identity profile. Windows
crash remnants are removed only after bounded prefix, type, owner, DACL, and
identity validation. Spill never falls back to a broadly accessible temporary
file. Without the required profile, bounded inline results remain available,
while a batch that requires spill returns a bounded error. The process-lifetime
notice still applies.

Body retrieval always uses IMAP PEEK. When requested, successfully retrieved IDs
are deduplicated and marked through the same application mutation workflow as
`mark_emails_as_read` in batches of at most 100. A known mark failure is logged
but does not discard successfully retrieved content. An unknown or
reconciliation-needed mark outcome stops later mark batches so the application
does not continue after ambiguous state.

## Composing messages

### `send_email`

Sends a message through the selected account's SMTP server. It supports:

- To, CC, and BCC recipients.
- Plain-text or HTML bodies.
- Attachments from file paths available to the server process. Relative paths use the process working directory; absolute paths are recommended.
- `Reply-To`, `In-Reply-To`, and `References` headers.

The tool is always present in the stable MCP catalog. The selected
`account_name` must itself be enabled and send-capable; an IMAP-only account is
rejected before SMTP access.

If a recipient allowlist is configured, every To, CC, and BCC address must be
allowed. SMTP delivery reports accepted, rejected, and unknown recipients
separately when the result is partial or ambiguous. Failed and unknown targets
include reviewed fixed diagnostics when available, for example
`smtp-mail-rejected`, `smtp-recipient-rejected`, `smtp-data-rejected`,
`smtp-data-unknown`, or `provider-timeout`. Unrecognized detail and raw provider
response text are omitted.

The response names the delivered message's RFC `Message-Id`: a clean send appends
`Message-Id: <...>` to the success line, and a partial delivery reports the same
identifier in its own `message-id` section. The server reports it only once the
provider has accepted the message data, so a rejected, timed-out, or otherwise
ambiguous delivery names no identifier at all rather than one it cannot vouch
for. A caller keeping its own record of sent mail can therefore store the
identifier exactly when the send is proven, and store nothing when it is not.
The independent Sent copy is not the source of this value; a failed or unknown
Sent copy does not remove the identifier of a delivered message.

Internationalized addr-specs in the envelope or From, Sender, To, Cc, Bcc, or
Reply-To fields, and non-ASCII Message-ID, In-Reply-To, or References syntax,
require the provider's SMTPUTF8 extension. The server requests `SMTPUTF8` and
serializes the complete message with the matching policy. If the extension is
unavailable, every target fails with `smtp-utf8-unsupported` before `MAIL FROM`,
`RCPT TO`, or message data is sent. RFC 6531 also requires SMTPUTF8 messages to
use `BODY=8BITMIME`; if the provider advertises SMTPUTF8 without 8BITMIME, every
target instead fails with `smtp-8bitmime-required` before `MAIL FROM`. A
non-ASCII display name with an ASCII addr-spec is encoded as an ordinary RFC
5322 display name and does not by itself require SMTPUTF8.

The server also classifies the final serialized message body before `MAIL FROM`.
Outside the SMTPUTF8 case above, a 7-bit-clean body uses ordinary SMTP `DATA`;
raw high-bit body bytes require the
provider's `8BITMIME` extension and are sent with `BODY=8BITMIME`. Without that
extension, every target fails with `smtp-8bitmime-required` before `MAIL FROM`.
A leaf containing raw high-bit payload bytes under a missing, `7bit`, base64, or
quoted-printable transfer-encoding label is rejected as
`smtp-mime-transport-invalid`; `8BITMIME` cannot repair a mismatched MIME label.
The same failure applies when a composite `multipart` or `message` entity uses a
forbidden base64/quoted-printable encoding, or labels actual 8-bit child data as
7-bit. Content that requires binary transport, including a MIME part declaring
`Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary`, NUL, bare line endings, or an overlong DATA
line, fails with `smtp-binarymime-unsupported`. The server does not currently
submit `BINARYMIME` through `CHUNKING`/`BDAT` and does not silently rewrite MIME
parts to downgrade them. Both transport failures occur before `MAIL FROM`,
`RCPT TO`, or message data is sent.

Saving the Sent copy is a second IMAP effect and is reported in its own
`sent-copy` section; a failed or unknown copy never changes an accepted delivery
into a failure. A successful-message-only Sent copy is permitted by `send`
without a separate `append` grant, but the effective `send` grant and other policy
are checked again before copying. Do not retry the whole send to repair a Sent copy. Sent-copy
APPEND payloads use CRLF line endings for compatibility with strict IMAP
providers. An internationalized Sent copy additionally requires RFC 6855
`ENABLE` plus `UTF8=ACCEPT` or `UTF8=ONLY`; unsupported negotiation is reported
as `utf8-append-unsupported` without changing the successful SMTP outcome.

### `save_draft`

Composes and saves a draft without SMTP. It requires `draft`, not `append`.
Pass the account and compose fields (recipients, subject, body, optional CC/BCC,
attachments and threading headers). An explicit empty recipient list is allowed;
every supplied recipient must match the recipient allowlist.

This tool has no mailbox or flags parameter. It uses the account's optional
`drafts_mailbox`, or the unique mailbox advertising special-use `\Drafts`,
and sets only `\Draft`. Missing or ambiguous discovery requires configuring
the account field; no mailbox is guessed or created. It shares the MIME/CRLF,
UTF-8 negotiation, attachment limits, and APPEND evidence behavior described
below for `save_to_mailbox`. A successful APPEND can have an unknown assigned
UID; an ambiguous result must not be replayed automatically.

### `save_to_mailbox`

Composes a message and appends it to an IMAP mailbox instead of sending it. It
works without SMTP and requires `append`, even for a draft destination. Use
`save_draft` for draft-only permission; this general tool is useful for templates
or explicit placements. It shares recipient,
body, attachment, and threading fields with `send_email`, adds `mailbox` and
`flags`, and does not support `reply_to`. For both compose tools, simple
Message-IDs in `in_reply_to` and `references` may be supplied with or without
angle brackets. The server adds missing brackets to each simple whitespace-separated
ID when constructing the RFC headers and does not double-wrap bracketed IDs.

The default mailbox is `Drafts`. When no explicit flags are supplied, the
message is saved with `\Draft` and `\Seen`. The response includes the RFC
message ID. It includes an assigned IMAP `email_id` only when the server returns
RFC 4315 `APPENDUID`; otherwise the value is `unknown`, and the target mailbox
must be searched before a later operation can address the saved message.

The same recipient allowlist used by `send_email` applies to this tool. The
complete MIME payload is serialized with CRLF line endings before IMAP APPEND for
compatibility with strict providers. Saved-message flags may be system flags or
provider keywords, but each must be one valid IMAP atom; legal values such as
`$Forwarded`, `project.name`, and `123flag` are accepted, while whitespace,
controls, and IMAP protocol specials are rejected. A case-insensitive `\Deleted`
flag additionally requires `delete` permission. Default full-grant accounts
retain the historical ability to append with this flag; `append` alone does not
permit it. This only flags the newly appended message and does not delete or
expunge any existing UID; use `delete_emails` for existing messages.

The server refreshes capabilities before mailbox selection. A message with
internationalized address or thread-header syntax requires RFC 6855, and a
`UTF8=ONLY` server requires `ENABLE UTF8=ACCEPT` even for an ordinary ASCII-header
message. In an enabled session, LIST names retain their literal UTF-8 spelling
and internationalized mailbox arguments use escaped UTF-8 rather than Modified
UTF-7. Only a message whose headers require RFC 6532 uses the RFC 6855 UTF8
literal form. Missing capability or incomplete ENABLE evidence fails before
SELECT/APPEND with `utf8-append-unsupported`. A known APPEND success without
`APPENDUID` returns `email_id: unknown`. A lost APPEND result is instead tagged
`unknown`; the server does not replay it because that could create a duplicate
draft.

### `forward_email`

Forwards an existing message to new recipients through the selected account's
SMTP server. The server reads the source message over IMAP, composes a new
message below an optional note from the caller, and re-attaches the original's
attachments.

| Parameter             | Default  | Description                                   |
| --------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `account_name`        | Required | Configured account identifier.                |
| `email_id`            | Required | UID of the source message to forward.         |
| `recipients`          | Required | Addresses that receive the forwarded message. |
| `source_mailbox`      | `INBOX`  | Mailbox that contains the source message.     |
| `body`                | `""`     | Note placed above the forwarded content.      |
| `cc`                  | None     | Additional CC recipients of the forward.      |
| `bcc`                 | None     | Additional BCC recipients of the forward.     |
| `include_attachments` | `true`   | Re-attach the source message's attachments.   |

The subject is derived from the source message as `Fwd: <original subject>`. A
source subject that already begins with `Fwd:` in any letter case is not
prefixed a second time.

The forwarded content is appended below the caller's note as a plain-text
`Forwarded message` block reporting the original's From, Recipients, Date, and
Subject. That block reports `Recipients:` rather than `To:` because the parsed
recipient list folds in Cc entries.

The block is re-composed from the parsed plain-text body, so the original's HTML
formatting is not preserved in the quoted text. The forwarded content is never
silently truncated: the composed body, including any note you supply, is bounded
at 1 MiB and an oversized forward is rejected outright. Forward a message when
the recipient needs its attachments and substance; when byte-exact rendering
matters, save the parts with `download_attachment` and compose the message
explicitly with `send_email`.

Attachments carried into the forward keep the source part's MIME main type,
subtype, and parameters instead of being coerced into `application/*`. Set
`include_attachments=false` to forward only the text.

Re-attached parts are bounded by the shared application limits: at most 20
retained parts, 25 MiB per part, and 50 MiB in total. Each size is the
conservative maximum of the part serialized under the SMTP and SMTPUTF8 wire
policies, including CRLF expansion. A source with more retained parts than the
limit is rejected after the read; forward its text with
`include_attachments=false` instead. Only parts the server classifies as
attachments are re-attached — an inline part with no filename and no attachment
disposition (for example a `Content-ID` image referenced by an HTML body) is
not carried, matching what the metadata and content tools report as
attachments. The quoting block reports the source's own Date header and omits
the line entirely when the source has none.

The tool is always present in the stable MCP catalog. The selected
`account_name` must itself be enabled and send-capable; an IMAP-only account is
rejected before the source message is read over IMAP and before any SMTP
access, so a non-send-capable account never downloads or parses the source.

The delivered forward passes through the same
[SMTP transport classification](#send_email) as any send. A re-attached source
part correctly labeled with an `8bit` transfer encoding rides `BODY=8BITMIME`
when the provider advertises it (the composed container is labeled `8bit` to
keep the message well formed) and fails with `smtp-8bitmime-required` when it
does not; mislabeled or binary source parts fail with the shared
`smtp-mime-transport-invalid` and `smtp-binarymime-unsupported` diagnostics
before `MAIL FROM`.

A forward performs three independent provider effects: the IMAP read of the
source message, SMTP delivery, and the IMAP Sent copy. Current account authority
is resolved for each effect. Send capability and recipient policy are checked
before the source read and again before SMTP; the source sender is also checked
against the freshly resolved sender policy before SMTP. Sent-copy follows the
same post-delivery authority rules as `send_email`. If the source message cannot
be read, the call fails before any SMTP session is opened, so a forward is never
delivered without the content and attachments it was supposed to carry. Delivery
and sent-copy outcomes are reported separately under the same rules as
`send_email`, and an ambiguous SMTP outcome is reported `unknown` and is never
replayed automatically. The forwarded message's `Message-Id` is reported under
the same rule: named once the provider accepted the message data, and omitted
for an ambiguous delivery.

Reading the source message is a mail read. When a sender allowlist is
configured, a message from a blocked sender is indistinguishable from a missing
message, so the forward fails without revealing that the message exists. If the
sender policy is tightened after the source read but before SMTP, the fresh
policy also aborts delivery with the same not-found-shaped error. The recipient
allowlist applies to the forward's To, CC, and BCC addresses exactly as it does
for `send_email`.

For a worked example, see
[Forward a message with its attachments](guides.md#forward-a-message-with-its-attachments).

## Mailbox and mutation tools

### `list_mailboxes`

Lists IMAP mailboxes with their names, hierarchy delimiters, and flags. Call it
before moving or saving messages when provider-specific folder names are not
known.

`pattern` defaults to `*`, and `reference` defaults to an empty string. The
account name and both IMAP LIST values are validated before provider access;
`pattern` must be non-empty and pattern/reference values are each limited to
1,024 UTF-8 bytes. Literal mailbox names are reassembled at their declared byte
length, tagged LIST completion text is not returned as a mailbox, and malformed
literal framing fails the request. Special-use flags such as `\Sent` are matched
case-insensitively for folder discovery.

### `set_email_flags`

Adds or removes approved IMAP flags from one or more message IDs in the selected
mailbox. `operation` must be `add` or `remove`, and applies to every supplied
flag. The non-empty `flags` list accepts unique values from:

- `\Seen`
- `\Flagged`
- `\Answered`
- `\Draft`

The provider sends one UID-scoped `+FLAGS.SILENT` or `-FLAGS.SILENT` operation
per message so results retain caller order and per-ID evidence. The operation is
logically idempotent, but an `unknown` result is not retried automatically
because the mailbox UID epoch or current authority may have changed.

`\Deleted` is intentionally rejected and remains owned by `delete_emails`,
which applies target-scoped expunge safety. `\Recent` is server-controlled, and
provider-specific keywords are not part of the portable public contract. To
mark a message unread, remove `\Seen`.

### `mark_emails_as_read`

Marks one or more message IDs as read in the selected mailbox. This focused
common-workflow tool uses the same implementation as `set_email_flags` with
`operation="add"` and `flags=["\\Seen"]`.

### `set_email_tags`

Adds or removes one or more configured writable tags. `operation` is `add` or
`remove`, and `tags` must contain one or more semantic names. Provider keywords
are not accepted as public input. Each requested tag must exist and have
`writable=true`; unknown or read-only tags are rejected before provider access.
The provider performs one UID-scoped `+FLAGS.SILENT` or `-FLAGS.SILENT` effect per
message. Standard flags and unrelated provider keywords are preserved.

### `move_emails`

Moves messages from `source_mailbox`, which defaults to `INBOX`. Specify exactly
one destination: an exact `destination_mailbox`, or `destination_role="junk"`
to discover the Junk folder. Existing explicit-destination calls and their
result sentences are unchanged. The resolved destination is returned on success
and also in partial/unknown results for role-based moves.

Junk discovery prefers one selectable mailbox with the RFC 6154 `\Junk`
attribute. Without one, it accepts one selectable common-name match: `Junk`,
`Spam`, `[Gmail]/Spam`, `Junk E-mail`, or `Junk Email`. Matching is
case-insensitive and preserves the actual server name. `\Noselect` mailboxes
are excluded; missing or multiple candidates require `list_mailboxes` and an
explicit destination. No folder is created, and moving to the source itself is
rejected. Discovery and the subsequent move both require `organize`; authority
is reopened after discovery and checked freshly before provider effects.

Native IMAP `MOVE` is preferred. The COPY-and-delete fallback is available only
when the server advertises `UIDPLUS`, allowing the source to be removed with
target-scoped `UID EXPUNGE`; otherwise the operation fails before copying.

#### Move to Junk and restore

1. List the source mailbox with `list_emails_metadata`; its UIDs belong to that
   mailbox only. Move selected IDs with `source_mailbox` and
   `destination_role="junk"` (omit `destination_mailbox`).
2. To restore, list messages in the resolved Junk mailbox again. Pass those
   current Junk UIDs to `move_emails`, with that exact `source_mailbox` and
   `destination_mailbox="INBOX"`.

Do not reuse a pre-move UID in another mailbox: destination UIDs can differ.
The caller decides which messages are spam or not spam. This workflow requests
mailbox moves only; it does not guarantee provider-side training or reporting.
Partial/unknown moves are not retried automatically. No separate spam/ham tools
are needed.

### `archive_emails`

Moves messages to the account's archive mailbox. The server first uses the RFC
6154 `\Archive` mailbox flag and then falls back to `Archive`, `Archives`, or
`[Gmail]/All Mail`. Archive uses the same native-MOVE or safe UIDPLUS fallback
rules as `move_emails`.

### `delete_emails`

Deletes one or more messages from the selected mailbox. The provider must
advertise `UIDPLUS`: the server flags and expunges only the requested UIDs with
`UID EXPUNGE` and never sends mailbox-wide `EXPUNGE`. Without `UIDPLUS`, the
operation fails before adding the `\Deleted` flag.

An all-known-success mutation keeps the existing success sentence. Partial or
ambiguous results use tagged `succeeded`, `failed`, and `unknown` sections in
input order. Unknown targets can include a fixed substep tag such as `store`,
`copy`, or `expunge-after-copy`. `unknown` means the provider effect may have
started but its final result was lost; the server does not replay it
automatically, and every result containing `unknown` includes a `reconciliation
needed` warning. The same warning also appears when a known provider effect may
be authoritative but the rebuildable local metadata projection could not be
invalidated.

Mutation requests accept 1 to 100 unique canonical positive decimal IMAP UIDs.
`set_email_flags` accepts one to four unique approved flags and exactly one
add/remove operation. Mailbox names are limited to 1,024 UTF-8 bytes. Compose
requests allow at most 100 total To/CC/BCC entries of at most 1,024 UTF-8 bytes
each; every entry must
contain exactly one address. Compose requests also allow a 64 KiB UTF-8 subject,
a 1 MiB UTF-8 body, and 20 attachments. Threading and Reply-To values
are limited to 64 KiB each. Each attachment path is limited to 4,096 bytes,
each existing attachment to 25 MiB, and their combined size to 50 MiB. Outbound
attachments preserve the inferred MIME main type and subtype (for example,
`image/png` remains `image/png`) instead of coercing every file to
`application/*`. Saved messages accept at most 100 flags of 128 bytes each before protocol syntax
validation. Mailbox names, recipient/header values, and subjects reject control
characters before provider access.

When a sender allowlist is active, blocked messages are never changed. See
[Sender allowlist](security.md#sender-allowlist) for the privacy behavior of
blocked IDs.

## Attachments

### `get_attachment_content`

Reads one named attachment as an MCP embedded binary resource without writing a
server-host file. The content-only result carries an opaque `email-attachment://`
URI, original filename, MIME type, decoded byte size, and one copy of the blob.
It is independently enabled with `enable_attachment_content=true`; enabling file
download does not enable MCP content transfer. The complete serialized tool
result must fit the server's existing global result ceiling.

### `download_attachment`

Downloads one named attachment from a message to the server host. By default,
the server creates a safe randomized filename under the current user's
`Downloads/mcp-email-server` directory. On Windows, it uses a valid Downloads
Known Folder registry value and otherwise falls back to the profile's `~/Downloads`; on
other platforms it uses `~/Downloads`. The returned
`saved_path` reports the resolved absolute destination.

`save_path` is optional. When supplied, it remains an exact destination: use an
absolute path when possible. A relative explicit path is resolved against the
server process's working directory.

The tool is registered even when downloading is disabled, but calling it then
raises a permission error. Enable it explicitly with:

```toml
enable_attachment_download = true
```

The application checks current account and feature policy, resolves and
preflights the local destination before provider construction, credential
resolution, download, or MIME decoding. For a default destination, it sanitizes
the attachment name, removes path/device syntax, adds a cryptographically random
suffix, and creates the application subdirectory with private permissions. It
checks authority again after fetch immediately before the write, so revocation
during a slow fetch discards the payload. Raw messages above 50 MiB and decoded
attachments above 25 MiB are rejected. The mail adapter returns bytes only and
never receives the resolved path.

The artifact adapter writes only the explicit or preflight-resolved destination.
It never falls back to the process working directory when default resolution
fails. POSIX uses pinned no-follow directory descriptors and owner-only files.
Windows supports only a local fixed NTFS drive-letter path and uses held
non-reparse handles, protected
DACLs, hard-link/identity checks, `FlushFileBuffers`, and same-volume
write-through replacement. Symlinked or junction parents, linked/permissive or
non-regular targets, UNC/network/device/alternate-stream/non-NTFS paths, and
replacement races fail closed. Existing private regular files may be replaced;
there is no weaker fallback.

Review [Attachment access](security.md#attachment-access) before enabling this
operation.

## Stable tool catalog

MCP initialization reports the installed `mcp-email-server` application version
in `serverInfo.version`, not the MCP SDK dependency version. The tool list is
static for the lifetime of a server process. `send_email`,
`list_allowed_recipients`, `list_allowed_senders`, and `download_attachment` are
always advertised. Account existence, enabled state, SMTP capability, and
current policies are enforced when each tool is called. The allowlist tools have
distinct empty semantics: an empty recipient list denies `send_email`,
`forward_email`, and `save_to_mailbox`, while an empty sender list does not
restrict reading. A recipientless `save_draft` remains permitted by `draft`;
any supplied recipient requires a match. Recipient entries support case-insensitive, whole-address glob
matching (`*`, `?`, and bracket expressions), such as `*@example.com`.
`*` or `*@*` explicitly permits all valid recipients for sending, forwarding,
and draft saves; this is not draft-only permission. Recipient denial errors
direct users to configure allowed addresses or patterns through the user-operated CLI/UI; this does not require
sharing credentials with the agent. Each list is limited to 1,000
entries, and the complete effective-configuration snapshot
is canonically serialized against the shared 8 MiB ceiling before either policy
result is returned; oversized authority data fails with `limit_exceeded`.

Account lifecycle changes therefore do not require a tools-list notification.
A bootstrap mode selection still requires a server restart because it changes
the selected configuration authority.

## Reply threading

To preserve conversation threading:

1. Fetch the original message with `get_emails_content`.
2. Use its RFC `message_id` as `in_reply_to`.
3. Build `references` from the returned `references` value followed by the
   original `message_id`, omitting missing values.
4. Send the reply with a suitable `Re:` subject.

Simple Message-IDs may be bare or already enclosed in angle brackets; the compose
path emits the required bracketed RFC form for both headers.

`send_email` and `forward_email` name the delivered message's own `Message-Id` in
their response, so a follow-up in the same thread can be built from it without
first locating the message again over IMAP.

For a complete example, see [Reply with proper threading](guides.md#reply-with-proper-threading).
