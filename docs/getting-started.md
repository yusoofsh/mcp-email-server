# Getting Started

This guide configures one email account and connects it to an MCP client over
stdio. See [Configuration](configuration.md) for headless environments,
multiple accounts, and advanced email server settings.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or later.
- IMAP credentials for the email account.
- SMTP credentials if the account must send email.
- An MCP-compatible client.

[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is recommended because `uvx` can run the
newest published PyPI package without a permanent installation.

## Version availability

This page documents the Local Email App V2 contract implemented by this source
tree: the embedded React management UI, SQLite-backed managed catalogs, the
`config` and `account` CLI commands, and a mail-only MCP catalog. Managed secrets
use the same private SQLite database by default on Linux and Windows; macOS uses
the system keyring.

PyPI 0.16.0 and earlier do not contain that contract. Those releases use the
legacy Gradio/TOML editor and MCP still exposes `add_email_account`. For a newer
release, verify that its release notes include “Local Email App V2” before using
the V2 instructions below. The `@latest` selector chooses the newest published
package; it does not select this source branch.

To run V2 from this checkout:

```bash
uv sync
uv run mcp-email-server ui
```

For a published release whose notes include Local Email App V2:

```bash
uvx mcp-email-server@latest ui
```

Use the same source checkout or published release for both `ui` and `stdio`. Do
not pair a V2 managed catalog with a pre-V2 MCP process.

## Upgrading to Local Email App V2

PyPI 0.16.0 and earlier expose the historical `add_email_account` MCP tool,
which accepts account credentials and writes legacy TOML configuration. Local
Email App V2 intentionally removes that tool; it is not renamed or replaced by
another MCP management tool. Account and credential changes must be completed
by the user through the authenticated loopback UI or interactive CLI.

Before upgrading, remove prompts, automation, and client allowlist entries that
invoke `add_email_account`. After upgrading, restart each MCP client so it
refreshes `tools/list`; a stale caller will no longer find that tool.

Existing TOML accounts remain available in `legacy` mode. To adopt managed mode,
initialize the migration destination, preview and explicitly apply `config
import-legacy`, test the accounts, and restart the MCP client when requested.
Preparation keeps legacy selected. A complete successful import automatically
selects managed mode when every source account type is supported; a failure or
unsupported provider keeps legacy selected. Import never modifies the source
TOML or its legacy keyring entries. The preview uses the effective
legacy view, so a complete environment account and environment policy overrides
are included with the same replacement/precedence rules used by legacy runtime.
Credential values remain absent from preview and are read only during confirmed
apply. Do not pass them through MCP or chat.

### Upgrading an existing managed catalog

Managed v3/v4 catalogs migrate to v5 on the first access by the new application.
Existing accounts retain full mutation grants by default; no permission reset
or account re-entry is required. Stop all older catalog users, keep a private
consistent backup, and upgrade UI, CLI, and MCP together before restarting the
clients. An older runtime cannot read v5, so a package-only downgrade is not a
rollback. See the [managed upgrade steps](configuration.md#upgrading-a-managed-catalog-to-v5).
Legacy TOML/environment users are not automatically switched to managed mode.

## Configure an account with the UI

Run one of the V2 commands in [Version availability](#version-availability).

The foreground command binds exactly to `127.0.0.1` on an ephemeral port and
opens one process-specific browser link. The link contains a one-time token in
its URL fragment; the frontend removes the fragment before exchanging it for a
local session. Keep the terminal open while using the UI. Use `--no-open` to
suppress browser launch or `--port PORT` to request a fixed loopback port.

On first use:

1. after the one-time browser authentication, let the UI prepare
   `managed.sqlite3` in the private directory shared by the legacy source and
   its separate bootstrap sidecar; this authenticated
   POST happens automatically only for a truly empty installation, while a
   detected legacy source requires an explicit **Import existing settings**
   preparation and review;
2. stay in **Email accounts** and choose **Add your first account**. Enter the
   email address and password. The UI derives a sender name and account nickname,
   fills known Google, Microsoft, iCloud, Yahoo, Fastmail, and Zoho connection
   settings, and otherwise suggests `imap.<email-domain>`. Review or override the
   editable server, login, port, security, and certificate details when needed.
   Outgoing mail and Sent-folder options remain optional;
3. use **Password** on the saved account to rotate or remove that account's saved
   password. A failed save leaves the current password authority unchanged.
   Provider connectivity testing is intentionally not
   available in the Web UI;
4. under **Settings & help**, add recipient addresses or glob patterns (for
   example `*@example.com`) and optional sender patterns as individual items.
   `*` explicitly allows every recipient for sending, forwarding, and drafts.
   No recipients disables sending and general saves; recipientless `save_draft`
   is still allowed by its mutation grant. No senders leaves reading unrestricted;
   choose global mutation permissions in this panel and inheritance or an
   explicit override in the account editor. Omitted settings retain all five
   write classes; choose an empty list for read-only. Set the optional draft
   mailbox on the account only if special-use Drafts discovery is unavailable
   or ambiguous;
5. saved complete accounts are immediately usable by managed runtime; there is
   no catalog activation or second save. Incomplete accounts remain visible in
   diagnostics but do not hide complete accounts;
6. restart every MCP client process after the UI reports that restart is
   required.

The UI has only two primary destinations: **Email accounts** for ordinary setup
and per-account semantic tags, and **Settings & help** for importing earlier
settings, sending/attachment safety, and bounded troubleshooting checks. The
attachment settings distinguish saving files on the server from returning bytes
through MCP for clients such as ChatGPT apps. Ordinary labels and errors use task language;
storage and concurrency terms are kept out of the primary workflow. Account creation
becomes available after the account list and inherited permissions finish loading.
Optional
settings are loaded only when their disclosure
is opened. On Linux and Windows, managed credentials default to the private
`managed_secret` table in the managed SQLite database. macOS uses the
operating-system keyring. Managed mode never falls back to TOML plaintext. The
interface is not a mail
client and never exposes message content. The same cleanup and headless
operations remain available through the managed CLI below.

## Configure an account with the managed CLI

For an explicit SQLite-backed catalog, install the command at a stable path and
run the direct workflow:

```bash
mcp-email-server config init \
  --database ~/.config/mcp-email-server/catalog.sqlite3
mcp-email-server account add work \
  --email john@example.com \
  --full-name "John Doe" \
  --imap-host imap.example.com
mcp-email-server account test work incoming
```

The account command reads the password through user-controlled terminal input
without placing it in argv. `account test` is the retained low-level,
agent-readable connectivity diagnostic; running it does not authorize any other
management operation. Managed mode requires the platform filesystem-security profile described in
[Security](security.md). POSIX uses owner/mode, no-follow, identity, and locking
primitives. Windows requires an ordinary local fixed NTFS drive-letter path and
uses handle-bound reparse/identity/DACL checks to protect both catalog state and
managed secrets. Managed mode does not fall back to legacy TOML plaintext or
weaker filesystem checks. Fresh initialization selects managed immediately unless existing v1
configuration needs reviewed import. Restart the MCP client when `config status`
reports that it is required. See
[Managed CLI setup](configuration.md#managed-cli-setup) for SMTP, stdin,
diagnostics, disablement, and switching back to legacy mode.

## Configure the MCP client

Add this server definition to the MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-email-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-email-server@latest", "stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the client after changing its configuration.

The explicit JSON configuration above works with Claude Desktop and other
clients that use the same `mcpServers` format. Account and credential management
is intentionally absent from MCP; use the local UI or your own terminal.

## Verify the connection

After restarting the client:

1. Ask it to list available email accounts. This calls
   `list_available_accounts`; select an entry with `can_receive=true` and require
   `can_send=true` before sending. If the list is empty, the agent should hand
   setup back to you and must not ask for a credential.
2. Ask it to list recent messages for the configured account. This calls
   `list_emails_metadata`.
3. If SMTP is configured through the managed workflow, make a non-destructive
   connectivity check with `mcp-email-server account test ACCOUNT outgoing`
   before asking the client to send. It authenticates, submits the configured
   account email address in `MAIL FROM`, and resets the transaction without
   `RCPT TO` or `DATA`; success does not prove final delivery. This CLI diagnostic
   remains available even though the Web UI has no Test connection action or
   route. Add the intended address to the allowed-recipient policy first; an empty recipient collection
   disables sending. `send_email` is always present in the static MCP tool
   catalog.

If the account is listed but a mail operation fails, check the IMAP or SMTP
host, port, TLS mode, username, and password. See
[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) for common failures.

## Install a published V2 release permanently

Use this path only for a release whose notes state that it includes Local Email
App V2. Instead of `uvx`, install that package into a managed environment:

```bash
pip install mcp-email-server
mcp-email-server ui
```

Then configure the client to invoke the installed executable:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-email-server": {
      "command": "mcp-email-server",
      "args": ["stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

If the executable is not on the client's `PATH`, replace
`mcp-email-server` with the absolute path returned by:

```bash
which mcp-email-server
```

On Windows, use `where mcp-email-server` instead. Managed storage must remain on
a local fixed NTFS drive under a validated parent directory; do not place the
catalog or configuration authority directly in the volume root or on a UNC path,
mapped network drive, FAT/exFAT volume, device namespace, or alternate data
stream.

## Run the official container image

Release 1.6.2 and later publish Linux `amd64` and `arm64` images to the current
canonical registry path:

```text
ghcr.io/wh1isper/mcp-email-server
```

Use a version tag for a controlled deployment or `latest` to follow the newest
release:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/wh1isper/mcp-email-server:1.6.2
docker run --rm ghcr.io/wh1isper/mcp-email-server:1.6.2 --version
```

The former `ghcr.io/ai-zerolab/mcp-email-server` package is historical and is
not updated by the current repository. The image entrypoint is
`mcp-email-server` and its default command is `stdio`. Keep stdin attached when
using it from an MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-email-server": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--env-file",
        "/absolute/path/to/mcp-email-server.env",
        "ghcr.io/wh1isper/mcp-email-server:1.6.2"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The env file uses the variables described in
[Configure without the UI](#configure-without-the-ui). Keep it outside the
source tree, restrict its permissions, and do not pass credentials as Docker
build arguments. Environment-only accounts do not require persistent container
storage.

For managed CLI configuration on a POSIX Docker host, bind a private host
directory, run with the host user's numeric identity, and select an explicit
container configuration path. This preserves the owner-only storage contract
instead of creating root-owned host files:

```bash
install -d -m 700 "$HOME/.config/mcp-email-server-container"
docker run --rm -it \
  --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  --env HOME=/config \
  --env MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_CONFIG_PATH=/config/config.toml \
  --mount "type=bind,src=$HOME/.config/mcp-email-server-container,dst=/config" \
  ghcr.io/wh1isper/mcp-email-server:1.6.2 \
  config init --database /config/managed.sqlite3
```

Reuse the same user, environment, and mount arguments for subsequent `account`
and server commands. Do not bind a host directory owned by a different user;
the managed storage preflight rejects it rather than weakening its ownership
checks. The local management UI intentionally binds only to container loopback and is not made
remote by publishing a Docker port; run the UI from a host installation or use
the managed CLI inside the container.

For Streamable HTTP, override the default command and configure the wildcard
bind plus the exact external Host/Origin values:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 \
  --env-file /absolute/path/to/mcp-email-server.env \
  -e MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e MCP_PORT=8000 \
  -e MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS='localhost:8000,127.0.0.1:8000' \
  -e MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS='http://localhost:8000' \
  ghcr.io/wh1isper/mcp-email-server:1.6.2 streamable-http
```

Review the reverse-proxy and authentication boundary in
[Transports](transports.md#reverse-proxies) before exposing HTTP beyond the
local machine. Maintainers can build and run the same image verification locally
with `make container-check`.

## Configure without the UI

For containers, CI, and headless systems, pass account settings as environment
variables in the MCP server definition. A minimal IMAP account looks like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-email-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-email-server@latest", "stdio"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_ACCOUNT_NAME": "work",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_EMAIL_ADDRESS": "john@example.com",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_HOST": "imap.example.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Add `MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_SMTP_HOST` to enable sending. See the complete
[environment variable reference](configuration.md#environment-variable-reference)
before deploying credentials this way.

The password in this example remains plaintext in the MCP client configuration
and process environment; `credential_storage` does not protect it. Prefer the
client, CI, or container platform's secret injection mechanism. If a literal
value is unavoidable, restrict the configuration file's permissions and keep
it out of version control and diagnostic output. Environment-composited legacy
accounts are runtime compatibility inputs; migrate them explicitly rather than
pasting their secrets into chat or asking an MCP client to manage accounts.
