These examples cover common configurations that need more control than the
basic UI provides.

## IMAP-only accounts

Remove SMTP configuration when an account must not send email:

```toml
[[emails]]
account_name = "archive"
full_name = "Archive Reader"
email_address = "archive@example.com"

[emails.incoming]
user_name = "archive@example.com"
password = "your-password"
host = "imap.example.com"
port = 993
use_ssl = true
start_ssl = false
verify_ssl = true
```

Or configure one through environment variables without
`MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_SMTP_HOST`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-email-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-email-server@latest", "stdio"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_ACCOUNT_NAME": "archive",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_EMAIL_ADDRESS": "archive@example.com",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD": "your-password",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_HOST": "imap.example.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`send_email` and `forward_email` remain in the static MCP tool list, but
calling either for this account fails its SMTP capability check before provider
access — for a forward, before the source message is read. IMAP mutation
tools remain available, so this is not a strict read-only mode. To limit
mutations, set `allowed_mutations = []` globally or on the account. Omitted
settings retain read/write access; an account null/omitted override inherits.

## Safe delete and move behavior

Message-scoped deletion never uses mailbox-wide IMAP `EXPUNGE`, which would
remove every message already marked `\Deleted`, including messages selected by
another email client. The server uses `UID EXPUNGE` only when the provider
advertises the RFC 4315 `UIDPLUS` capability.

If a provider lacks `UIDPLUS`, `delete_emails` reports the requested messages as
failed before changing their flags. When the provider also lacks native `MOVE`,
`move_emails` rejects its COPY-and-delete fallback before copying anything. Use
the provider's own client or an IMAP server that supports `MOVE` or `UIDPLUS`.

## Move suspected spam to Junk and restore it

Use `move_emails` for both directions; this requires `organize` permission.
First list messages in the source mailbox. For a UID listed in `INBOX`, call:

```json
{
  "account_name": "work",
  "email_ids": ["42"],
  "source_mailbox": "INBOX",
  "destination_role": "junk"
}
```

Do not also pass `destination_mailbox`. The result names the resolved folder,
which may be localized rather than named `Junk`. If discovery is missing or
ambiguous, inspect `list_mailboxes` and use an exact `destination_mailbox`
instead. See [Junk discovery](tools.md#move_emails) for the selection rules.

To restore, list messages again in that resolved folder. If the newly listed
UID is `73` and the folder was `Junk`, call:

```json
{
  "account_name": "work",
  "email_ids": ["73"],
  "source_mailbox": "Junk",
  "destination_mailbox": "INBOX"
}
```

The example UIDs are illustrative; use values from the actual source listing,
not the old pre-move UID. The caller decides whether a message is spam. These
calls request mailbox moves and do not guarantee service-provider training or
reporting. Inspect partial/unknown results before deciding what to do next;
never replay an ambiguous move automatically.

## ProtonMail Bridge and self-signed TLS

Local bridges commonly expose IMAP through STARTTLS with a locally issued
certificate. A typical environment configuration is:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-email-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-email-server@latest", "stdio"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_ACCOUNT_NAME": "protonmail",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_EMAIL_ADDRESS": "john@example.com",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD": "bridge-password",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_PORT": "1143",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_SSL": "false",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_START_SSL": "true",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_VERIFY_SSL": "false",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_SMTP_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_SMTP_PORT": "1025",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_SMTP_SSL": "false",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_SMTP_START_SSL": "true",
        "MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_SMTP_VERIFY_SSL": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Equivalent TOML:

```toml
[[emails]]
account_name = "protonmail"
full_name = "John Doe"
email_address = "john@example.com"

[emails.incoming]
user_name = "bridge-username"
password = "bridge-password"
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 1143
use_ssl = false
start_ssl = true
verify_ssl = false

[emails.outgoing]
user_name = "bridge-username"
password = "bridge-password"
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 1025
use_ssl = false
start_ssl = true
verify_ssl = false
```

Use the exact credentials and ports shown by the local bridge. Disable
certificate verification only for a bridge running on a trusted local endpoint.

## Separate IMAP and SMTP credentials

Some providers or bridges issue separate credentials. With environment
variables, keep the required shared password and override each protocol:

```bash
MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_EMAIL_ADDRESS='john@example.com'
MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_USER_NAME='john@example.com'
MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD='required-shared-fallback'
MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_USER_NAME='imap-user'
MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_PASSWORD='imap-password'
MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_IMAP_HOST='imap.example.com'
MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_SMTP_USER_NAME='smtp-user'
MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_SMTP_PASSWORD='smtp-password'
MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_SMTP_HOST='smtp.example.com'
```

The generic `MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD` currently remains required to create an
environment-provided account, even when both protocol-specific passwords are
set.

In TOML, set `user_name` and `password` independently in the incoming and
outgoing tables.

## Save messages to a custom Sent folder

If Sent folder auto-detection does not select the provider's folder, set it
explicitly:

```toml
[[emails]]
account_name = "work"
save_to_sent = true
sent_folder_name = "INBOX.Sent"
```

Before choosing a value, call `list_mailboxes` and inspect the returned names
and flags. Set `save_to_sent = false` if the provider already saves SMTP mail
and a second IMAP append would create duplicates.

## Save a draft

Call `save_draft` with the account and compose fields. It requires `draft` and
uses the configured `drafts_mailbox` or the unique special-use `\Drafts`
mailbox, with only the `\Draft` flag. There is no mailbox or flags parameter.
Use `recipients=[]` for an unfinished recipientless draft; any supplied To/CC/BCC
recipient must match the allowlist. For explicit placement and flags, use
`save_to_mailbox` with `append` permission instead.

Conceptual MCP call:

```python
await save_draft(
    account_name="work",
    recipients=["alice@example.com"],
    subject="Project update",
    body="Draft content",
)
```

Mailbox names vary by provider. If special-use discovery is missing or
ambiguous, use `list_mailboxes` and set the exact existing `drafts_mailbox` on
the account; the draft tool never guesses or creates a mailbox. If any address or thread-header identifier requires
internationalized syntax, the IMAP endpoint must support RFC 6855
`ENABLE`/`UTF8=ACCEPT`; otherwise the save fails before mailbox selection with
`utf8-append-unsupported` and is not retried.

## Reply with proper threading

First fetch the original message and read its RFC thread headers:

```python
result = await get_emails_content(
    account_name="work",
    email_ids=["123"],
)
original = result.emails[0]
```

Build the ancestor chain from the returned `references` value and the immediate
parent's `message_id`, then send the reply:

```python
references = " ".join(value for value in (original.references, original.message_id) if value) or None

await send_email(
    account_name="work",
    recipients=[original.sender],
    subject=f"Re: {original.subject}",
    body="Thank you for your email.",
    in_reply_to=original.message_id,
    references=references,
)
```

`in_reply_to` and `references` are nullable because not every message belongs to
a thread or has a valid Message-ID. Simple Message-IDs may be supplied bare or
inside angle brackets; the compose path adds missing brackets to each simple ID
and preserves already bracketed values. The server returns `references` as one
whitespace-normalized string rather than guessing how to tokenize malformed or
historical header syntax. Treat both values as untrusted observations: compose
validation rejects malformed values containing control characters, and unusual
legacy syntax is preserved rather than partially rewritten.

## Forward a message with its attachments

Locate the message with `list_emails_metadata`, then forward it by UID. The
subject and the quoted content are derived from the source message, so the
caller supplies only the note that goes above them:

```python
await forward_email(
    account_name="work",
    email_id="123",
    source_mailbox="INBOX",
    recipients=["alice@example.com"],
    body="Forwarding this for your records; the signed contract is attached.",
)
```

The delivered subject becomes `Fwd: <original subject>`, and the original's
attachments are re-attached with their MIME types and parameters preserved. Pass
`include_attachments=False` to forward only the text.

The quoted block is rebuilt from the parsed plain-text body, so an HTML-heavy
original arrives without its formatting. Nothing is silently truncated: the
composed body, note included, is bounded at 1 MiB, and a forward that exceeds it
is rejected rather than trimmed. When the recipient needs the message exactly as
it was sent, save the parts with `download_attachment` and compose the message
yourself with `send_email`.

Forwarding requires SMTP, so it fails its capability check for an
[IMAP-only account](#imap-only-accounts). If the source message cannot be read,
including when a sender allowlist hides it, the call fails before any SMTP
session is opened, so a forward is never sent without the attachments it was
supposed to carry.

## Read a long message in chunks

`get_emails_content` returns at most `max_body_length` characters for each
message. If the body ends with `...[TRUNCATED]`, request the next window:

```python
first = await get_emails_content(
    account_name="work",
    email_ids=["123"],
    body_offset=0,
    max_body_length=20000,
)

second = await get_emails_content(
    account_name="work",
    email_ids=["123"],
    body_offset=20000,
    max_body_length=20000,
)
```

Keep the mailbox argument consistent with the mailbox used to obtain the
`email_id`.

## Work with semantic email tags

Start by calling `list_email_tags(account_name="work")`. A request such as
“messages requiring an action” can then resolve to the configured `todo` name.
Filter with `list_emails_metadata(semantic_tags=["todo"], tag_match="all")`.
Add or remove the tag with
`set_email_tags(email_ids=["123"], operation="add", tags=["todo"])` or
`operation="remove"`. Tool inputs use semantic names only, and mutation requires
the configured tag to have `writable=true`.

## Return attachments to ChatGPT or another remote MCP app

A remote ChatGPT app or custom MCP client does not share the server's filesystem.
A path returned by `download_attachment` therefore remains a path on the machine
running `mcp-email-server`; it is not an attachment the remote client can read.

For that setup, expose the server through the HTTPS transport expected by the
client, or through a trusted secure MCP tunnel, and explicitly enable attachment
content transfer:

```toml
enable_attachment_content = true
```

In managed mode, enable **Allow attachments to be returned through MCP** in the
local management UI instead. Then call `get_attachment_content` with the message
ID and filename returned by `get_emails_content`. The tool returns the attachment
as one embedded binary resource without creating a local file. This setting is
independent of `enable_attachment_download`; enable only the mode your client
uses. The complete encoded result must fit the server's existing global result
ceiling.

## Import legacy accounts into a managed catalog

Create the destination while keeping legacy runtime selected, preview the
effective legacy source, and apply only after reviewing every action:

```bash
mcp-email-server config init \
  --database ~/.config/mcp-email-server/catalog.sqlite3
mcp-email-server config import-legacy
mcp-email-server config import-legacy --apply
# Review the displayed plan, then type IMPORT at the prompt.
mcp-email-server account list
mcp-email-server account test work incoming
# Restart MCP clients when config status reports restart_required=true.
```

The source uses the TOML file selected by `MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_CONFIG_PATH` plus
the same complete environment-account replacement/addition and policy override
precedence as legacy runtime. Preview displays endpoint, TLS, user,
save-to-sent, policy, credential source class, and exact target revision details
without accessing credential values or the keyring, so it can still show actions
while the legacy keyring is locked. `--apply` prints that complete plan before
accepting the interactive `IMPORT` confirmation; a no-op plan does not prompt.
Apply then fails safely if a required current TOML, environment, or keyring
credential cannot be read. A full successful import automatically selects
managed mode. Any failure keeps legacy selected; unsupported provider account
types are reported and prevent automatic cutover.

A `conflict` means the destination already has a different account with that
normalized name or retains a soft-removal tombstone. Import never overwrites
that row.
Resolve it deliberately by choosing a fresh catalog or reconciling the account
manually. An exact repeat is `unchanged`; an interrupted matching import
can report `resume_credentials` and install only missing bindings. The source is
left untouched in every case.

## Optional Codex and Claude Code plugin

The repository publishes one optional plugin through the Codex and Claude Code
marketplace manifests. Both manifests reference the same root `.mcp.json`, which
starts `uvx --from mcp-email-server@latest mcp-email-server-plugin` as a local
bundled MCP server, plus the canonical `safe-email-operations` skill. The
plugin-only entry point is absent from legacy releases, so they fail closed
instead of exposing their older MCP catalog. This local stdio integration is for
Codex, ChatGPT desktop, and Claude Code hosts that support local plugin processes;
it is not a remote ChatGPT web connector.

Plugin and Python application releases are independent. The plugin version
changes only when the bundled manifest, MCP declaration, skill, or related plugin
content changes. `@latest` deliberately resolves the current published Python
application, so first use can require network access and the running application
can advance without a plugin update. Installing the plugin does not store email
credentials, but enabling it allows the host to resolve the package and start the
server locally. `uvx` must already be available on `PATH`.

The MCP surface contains mail operations, not account or credential management.
The skill allows only the bounded `@latest` version check plus `config status
--json` and `config doctor --json`, validates the JSON schema/command fields, and
hands all account creation or credential entry back to the user-operated terminal
or local browser. JSON availability on another command does not grant the agent
permission to run it. The plugin must never launch the UI, copy its bootstrap URL,
edit the catalog directly, or accept a secret in chat.

Before installation, inspect the official repository source, both marketplace
manifests, both plugin manifests, `.mcp.json`, and the canonical skill.
Installation, update, enablement, and removal are explicit user actions. The
complete commands and source-verification checklist live in the plugin's
`references/installation.md`; never curl and execute an installer or put
repository credentials in a marketplace URL.

If a user asks an agent to add an account or rotate a password, the safe handoff
is: run `uvx mcp-email-server@latest ui` locally and complete secret entry in the
browser, or use the documented masked interactive CLI in the user's terminal. Do not
paste credentials or the one-time UI URL into chat. If no user-controlled
terminal or browser is available, setup cannot be completed safely through the
plugin.

## Containers and CI

For non-interactive environments:

- Supply account settings through environment variables or mount a protected
  TOML file and set `MCP_EMAIL_SERVER_CONFIG_PATH`.
- Use `credential_storage = "plaintext"` only when the mounted secret file is
  appropriately protected, or provide a functional keyring backend.
- Expect `auto` to fall back to plaintext when no D-Bus keyring session exists.
- Bind HTTP transports to the required interface and configure explicit allowed
  hosts and origins.
- Mount only the directories needed for attachment upload or download.

See [Security](security.md) and [Transports](transports.md) before exposing the
service outside a local development environment.
