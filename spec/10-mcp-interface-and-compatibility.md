# 10. MCP Interface and Compatibility

## Baseline

MCP stdio is the supported managed mail-workflow interface. SSE and Streamable
HTTP compatibility commands may remain available, but they do not weaken
managed authority or create a remotely supported management plane. MCP Apps are
not delivered in this milestone.

The public MCP contract includes tool/resource names, descriptions, annotations,
visibility, input schemas, output schemas where exposed, result literals and
shapes, error categories, and transport behavior. These are compatibility
surface, not incidental implementation details.

## Static Catalog

The tool and resource catalog is fixed for the process lifetime. A tool does not
disappear when mode, account, policy, or provider capability makes a call
unavailable. Instead, the application service checks current authority at call
time and returns a bounded typed denial.

`save_draft` is an independent tool, not a visibility-dependent alias for
`save_to_mailbox`. Its schema exposes compose fields but no mailbox or flags;
its destination and mutation authority are owned by specs 04 and 07. The complete
catalog remains advertised for read-only and selectively granted accounts too.

Junk/restore workflows reuse `move_emails`, not new spam/ham tool names. Its
optional `destination_role="junk"` is mutually exclusive with the now-optional
`destination_mailbox`; all previous valid explicit-destination calls remain
valid. Source-mailbox/UID ownership and destination discovery are owned by
spec 07. The catalog snapshot locks the additive input change, unchanged output
schema, and role-based resolved-mailbox result wording.

This preserves client discovery caches while ensuring a permissive startup state
does not authorize a later effect. Tool list callbacks MUST NOT resolve secrets,
contact providers, or scan mailboxes.

A complete version-controlled contract snapshot/assertion covers every exported:

- tool and resource name;
- human description;
- input and output JSON schema;
- required/optional field and default;
- enum and numeric/string/array bound;
- annotations and visibility;
- success and tagged partial-result shape.

Tests fail on addition, removal, schema drift, or description drift unless the
change is intentionally reviewed as a public contract change. MCP initialization
advertises the installed `mcp-email-server` application version, never the MCP
SDK dependency version, and raw protocol tests lock that identity.

## Agent Discovery and Tool Hints

Account discovery projects configuration models into one explicit non-secret
DTO. Each item contains only `account_name`, `account_type`, `description`, an
optional email identity, and `can_receive`/`can_send` capabilities. Description
bytes have an application-owned 4 KiB ceiling and the output schema exposes the
same structural bound. Text content, `structuredContent`, the account resource,
and output schema describe the same
fields; persistence models, timestamps, endpoints, masked credential objects,
and provider internals do not cross this boundary. An empty list directs the
agent to hand setup to the user-operated CLI/UI and never request credentials.

Every tool publishes all four standard MCP annotation hints. They are reviewed
against worst-case behavior across optional parameters:

- local/remote discovery reads are read-only and idempotent; provider reads are
  open-world while local authority reads are not;
- `get_emails_content` is not marked read-only because `mark_as_read=true` can
  change remote flags, but that flag effect is idempotent;
- send and append are non-read-only, non-idempotent, open-world additions rather
  than destructive replacement;
- approved flag add/remove and the focused mark-read entry point are
  non-destructive idempotent remote mutations; `\Deleted` is not accepted by
  the generic flag tool;
- delete, move, and archive are destructive, non-idempotent remote mutations;
- attachment download is a non-idempotent filesystem write that may replace the
  caller-selected destination, while attachment-content retrieval is a read-only
  open-world provider read with no filesystem effect.

Annotations are advisory planning and approval hints. They are never treated as
an authorization, credential, policy, idempotency-proof, or safe-retry boundary;
descriptions and typed unknown outcomes continue to forbid automatic replay after
ambiguous effects.

## No-secret and No-management Boundary

No tool/resource schema in either mode contains a password, token, private key,
secret value, reusable secret locator, set/rotate credential command, account
writer, import command, or generic management RPC. No result exposes binding
locators.

The historical `add_email_account` tool is intentionally removed from the
catalog. Host approval, HITL UI, annotations, or optional elicitation cannot
prevent a secret-bearing tool argument from entering model/client/protocol logs
and are not a portable credential channel. Interactive CLI and authenticated
local Web UI are the supported replacements; optional agent integrations provide
only the safe handoff defined in spec 11.

## Tool Families

The stable mail catalog may expose these compatibility families:

- account/mailbox discovery;
- metadata listing and querying;
- body and attachment reads;
- flag/read-state mutations;
- semantic keyword discovery, filtering, and explicitly authorized tag
  mutations;
- save/append, move, archive, and delete;
- SMTP send and sent-copy behavior.

Exact names and schemas are owned by the checked contract snapshot. Their
workflow semantics and safety are owned by specs 06 and 07. Account, policy,
credential, import, doctor, agent-installation, and UI-session operations are not
MCP tools.

## Request and Result Bounds

Every schema advertises enforceable structural bounds where MCP/JSON Schema can
express them. Application services enforce them again for direct callers.
MCP-specific ceilings include:

- maximum serialized success/partial response bytes;
- maximum mailbox items and aggregate mailbox-name/attribute bytes;
- maximum per-item and aggregate metadata/body detail;
- at most the centralized flag-count bound for configured or requested semantic
  tags; embedded attachment content must fit the same canonical serialized-result
  ceiling as every other MCP result;
- maximum target IDs, recipients, headers, and message bytes;
- maximum warnings, failures, unknown outcomes, and error-detail bytes;
- bounded string lengths for account/description/mailbox/path/query fields;
- canonical positive decimal ASCII UID patterns, ranges, and collection sizes,
  revalidated at both application and low-level provider entry points;
- maximum effective account and recipient/sender policy discovery cardinality;
- command/provider deadlines where safely enforceable.

Before returning, the adapter serializes or estimates with the canonical encoder
and rejects, reduces, or returns the explicit process-private oversized-result
handoff owned by spec 03 according to the documented result policy. It cannot
return an unbounded Python value merely because request cardinality was bounded.
Errors are shorter than the normal response ceiling and never include raw
provider responses, SQL, traceback, secret, body, or unintended local path.

The IMAP SEARCH pre-cardinality residual is documented in spec 06; after the
response arrives, candidate count/bytes are checked before any fetch or MCP
result construction.

## Result Semantics

Existing exact success literals remain exact where clients depend on them.
Multi-target/effect workflows use tagged bounded per-item outcomes and preserve
input order. They distinguish failure from unknown and provider success from
local projection/sent-copy warnings.

Errors caused by invalid input, policy denial, disabled/removed account, missing
binding, provider capability, conflict, limit, timeout, unknown effect, busy,
insecure storage, and internal failure map to stable safe categories. Framework
validation errors are normalized when necessary so they do not leak internals or
produce uncontrolled detail.

## Stdio Correctness

In stdio mode:

- stdout contains MCP protocol frames only;
- logs and diagnostics use stderr and obey redaction;
- startup freezes and preflights authority before protocol serving;
- malformed UTF-8/JSON and frames above the production-owned 2 MiB stdio
  ceiling produce bounded, redacted handling without echoing input;
- request cancellation is propagated to application checkpoints;
- EOF, cancellation, initialization failure, and normal shutdown close all
  constructed resources;
- no browser UI, bootstrap token, HTTP route, or management server starts.

A generic MCP client or raw JSON-RPC harness validates initialization, exact
catalog serialization, malformed and oversized recovery, invocation,
cancellation, idle and in-flight EOF, runtime cleanup, and stdout purity in
addition to direct Python tests.

## Compatibility and Evolution

A public catalog change requires:

1. update to the exact contract snapshot and relevant domain spec;
2. compatibility and security analysis plus migration/release note;
3. generic-client and GreenMail stdio validation;
4. a versioned alternative when semantics cannot be changed compatibly, unless
   retaining the old surface would preserve a material security flaw.

Removal of `add_email_account` is the explicit security exception: preserving a
credential-bearing MCP compatibility shim would violate the no-secret boundary.
Release notes and agent/CLI/UI guidance provide migration rather than emulation.
The V2 pre-release correction from polymorphic configuration output to the
explicit account-discovery DTO, and the addition of reviewed annotations, are
intentional catalog changes covered by exact snapshots and raw protocol tests;
they do not change the no-management boundary.

The current numeric message ID stays a compatibility field without claiming
UIDVALIDITY provenance. Introducing an epoch-bound identifier is additive or
versioned, never a silent reinterpretation.

The full-content result additively exposes nullable `in_reply_to` and
`references` fields. They are optional in the output schema, do not alter tool
inputs, and are serialized as `null` when absent. Metadata-list output remains
unchanged, so the addition does not imply indexed or persisted thread headers.
Exact catalog, direct application, raw stdio, and GreenMail tests cover the new
result shape. Clients that reject unknown output fields must update their result
type before consuming this catalog revision.

This delivery adds no `ui://` resources, MCP App metadata, embedded-app CSP, or
host bridge calls. `get_attachment_content` is a transport-neutral MCP read tool
that can be enabled for ChatGPT apps and other clients without a shared local
filesystem; it does not turn this server into an MCP App or remote management
plane.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A complete exact catalog snapshot covers names, descriptions, input/output
   schemas, annotations, resources, visibility, and result shapes.
2. Schemas and results in both modes contain no secret input, value, reusable
   locator, or management operation; `add_email_account` is absent.
3. Tool visibility is static while current mode, lifecycle, policy, binding, and
   capability are enforced at invocation.
4. Schema, application, provider-work, serialized-response, spill-artifact, and
   error-detail bounds are tested at, below, and above each limit.
5. Partial results preserve order and distinguish known failure, unknown effect,
   provider success with local warning, and sent-copy outcome.
6. Raw protocol tests prove application-version identity, stdout purity,
   initialization/catalog behavior, malformed/oversized handling, cancellation,
   EOF, and cleanup.
7. GreenMail stdio E2E exercises representative read and mutation workflows
   through actual MCP framing, not only helper calls.
8. Every tool has reviewed read-only, destructive, idempotent, and open-world
   hints, and account discovery text/structured/schema representations agree on
   the explicit non-secret capability DTO.
9. The catalog contains no MCP App, account/credential management, agent
   installation, or graphical management resource.
10. The catalog and raw stdio tests cover `list_email_tags`, tag-aware
    `list_emails_metadata` and `get_emails_content`, `set_email_tags`, and
    `get_attachment_content`, including defaults, semantic-name inputs,
    annotations, schemas, one-copy embedded blob content, the global result
    ceiling, and policy failures.
