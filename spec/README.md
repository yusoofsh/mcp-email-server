# Local Email App Specifications

This directory defines the normative product and architecture contracts for the
Local Email App and its optional single-operator hosted OAuth front end. The
documents are organized by domain and design ownership.
They describe the intended behavior and acceptance conditions; they do not claim
that a requirement is implemented merely because it appears here.

User-facing behavior belongs under [`docs/`](../docs/). Implementation plans,
research notes, migration diaries, and test logs do not belong in these specs.

## Product Definition

The Local Email App connects one operating-system user on one machine to existing
IMAP and SMTP accounts. It exposes mail workflows to MCP clients and provides a
local management plane through CLI and an authenticated loopback Web UI.

The product has two explicit configuration modes:

- **legacy** preserves the existing TOML, environment-composition, and legacy
  credential behavior;
- **managed** uses SQLite as the authority for non-secret configuration and a
  `SecretStore` as the authority for credentials.

IMAP remains authoritative for mailbox membership, message placement, metadata,
and flags. SMTP responses remain authoritative for delivery evidence. SQLite
contains local authority only where explicitly stated and otherwise contains
bounded, rebuildable observations.

## Cross-cutting Invariants

1. A persisted managed selection never falls back to legacy automatically.
2. The selected mode is frozen for a process. Changing it requires restart.
3. Account and policy authority is revalidated before each independent provider
   effect.
4. Managed credentials are resolved only for the selected account and required
   endpoint role, immediately before provider construction. Secret values do not
   enter application DTOs, process-wide settings caches, SQLite, any MCP input or
   result, agent chat/skill state, URLs, logs, diagnostics, or browser storage.
5. Network, `SecretStore`, and large filesystem operations never run inside a
   SQLite transaction.
6. A durable IMAP placement identity includes operational account, mailbox,
   UIDVALIDITY, and UID. The existing public numeric email ID is a compatibility
   identifier, not proof of the listing epoch.
7. Partial observation never proves provider deletion by absence.
8. Body reads use PEEK unless the caller explicitly requests a separate read
   mutation.
9. Scoped delete and move fallback never issue mailbox-wide bare `EXPUNGE`.
10. An ambiguous provider effect is reported as unknown and is never
    automatically replayed.
11. SMTP delivery and sent-copy APPEND are separate effects; sent-copy failure
    never causes SMTP resubmission.
12. Public requests, provider work after cardinality is known, local work,
    serialized results, and error details have explicit bounds. Basic IMAP
    SEARCH's pre-cardinality UID response is the sole documented provider-payload
    residual and is constrained by a command deadline plus a strict
    post-response candidate ceiling.
13. The stdio tool catalog remains stable for the life of a process; current
    authority and capability are enforced at call time.
14. Attachment materialization preserves the caller's exact requested
    destination for compatibility, but only after explicit enablement, fresh
    policy validation, bounded fetch, and no-follow filesystem checks.
15. The local Web UI binds only to `127.0.0.1`, uses an ephemeral port by
    default, has no share/remote mode, and treats every browser request as
    untrusted until authenticated and CSRF-validated.
16. MCP exposes no account or credential management. Optional agent skills hand
    users off to interactive CLI/UI and never collect or relay credentials.

| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MCP stdio             | bounded mail discovery and mail workflows; no account management or secret entry |
| CLI                   | complete headless management, recovery, automation, and safe secret input        |
| Local Web UI          | complete graphical management plane; no mailbox reader or composer               |
| Agent skill/plugin    | optional local MCP packaging plus non-secret discovery and CLI/UI handoff        |
| SSE / Streamable HTTP | retained compatibility commands, not the target managed architecture             |
| MCP Apps              | not part of this delivery; requires a separate accepted proposal                 |

The existing public `mcp-email-server ui` command remains the graphical entry
point and is replaced in place by the embedded local React UI. There is no new
`webui` command and no daemon.

## Scope

The delivery governed by these specs includes:

- immediate managed initialization for fresh installs, v1-safe reviewed migration, selection, and diagnostics;
- account create/read/update/disable/re-enable/soft-remove;
- managed policy and credential lifecycle;
- preview-first, explicit legacy import;
- shared application services for CLI, Web UI, and MCP adapters;
- bounded mailbox, metadata, body, attachment, and mutation workflows;
- a bounded metadata projection in SQLite;
- an authenticated loopback management UI packaged inside Python artifacts;
- a repository-distributed Codex/Claude Code integration that guides safe setup
  without accepting credentials;
- removal of the historical secret-bearing MCP account-add tool with migration
  guidance to interactive CLI/UI;
- complete contract, security, package, and GreenMail validation.

It does not include:

- hosted or multi-user service behavior;
- a daemon or background synchronizer;
- a remotely supported management API;
- MCP Apps;
- full offline mail replication;
- FTS, persistent bodies, raw MIME, or attachment payload storage;
- QRESYNC/VANISHED optimization;
- generic operation journals, leases, evidence ledgers, or continuity systems;
- online backup/restore or hard purge;
- exactly-once guarantees for ambiguous IMAP or SMTP effects.

## Specification Language

`MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `SHOULD`, and `MAY` are normative. Each detailed document
ends with acceptance criteria. Verification evidence is centralized in
[`12-delivery-validation-and-evolution.md`](12-delivery-validation-and-evolution.md),
so specs remain stable contracts instead of implementation logs.
