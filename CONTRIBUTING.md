# Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `mcp-email-server` for local development.
Please note this documentation assumes you already have `uv` and `Git` installed and ready to go.

1. Fork the `mcp-email-server` repo on GitHub.

2. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
cd <directory_in_which_repo_should_be_created>
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_NAME/mcp-email-server.git
```

3. Now we need to install the environment. Navigate into the directory

```bash
cd mcp-email-server
```

Then, install and activate the environment with:

```bash
uv sync
```

4. Install pre-commit to run linters/formatters at commit time:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

5. Create a branch for local development:

```bash
git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

Now you can make your changes locally.

6. Don't forget to add test cases for your added functionality to the `tests` directory.

7. When you're done making changes, run the formatting, linting, type, lockfile, and dependency checks.

```bash
make check
```

8. Validate that all unit tests and documentation checks are passing:

```bash
make test
make docs-test
make test-browser
make container-check
```

`make test` combines coverage from the main pytest process and Python
subprocesses, then enforces the 80% aggregate project baseline. Codecov also
requires 80% coverage for changed lines. A focused diagnostic run may use
`--cov-fail-under=0`, but the complete suite must pass the configured threshold
before submission. Add tests for meaningful behavior and failure or security
boundaries rather than percentage-only execution.

Frontend changes require Node 22.12 or later. Rebuild and stage the locked React
assets before the Python checks:

```bash
make frontend
```

`make frontend` runs `npm ci`, lint, type checking, unit tests, and the Vite
production build, then replaces the embedded assets after checking for missing,
stale, remote, source-map, service-worker, and MCP-App files. It also refreshes
`frontend/embedded-assets.json`, which binds the maintainer source tree and build
script to exact staged asset hashes. Normal PEP 517 wheel/sdist builds run only
`make frontend-check`; rebuilding a wheel from the sdist and UI startup never
invoke Node or access npm. Commit frontend source, `package-lock.json`, the asset
manifest, third-party notices, and the corresponding staged
`mcp_email_server/web_ui/static` files together.

Changes to IMAP, SMTP, MCP stdio, configuration loading, attachment handling, or
mailbox mutations should also run the Docker-backed black-box baseline:

```bash
make test-e2e
```

This command requires Docker, starts an isolated GreenMail instance bound only
to loopback, and removes it after the test. See the
[validation guide](https://mcp-email-server.wh1isper.top/validation/) for the
covered flows and limitations.

Windows is a first-class runtime target. Keep Win32 filesystem details behind
`mcp_email_server/windows_security.py`; application and domain workflows remain
platform-neutral. Changes to bootstrap/catalog storage, SQLite WAL/SHM,
attachments, large-result spill, locks, replacement, or cleanup must add the
applicable native cases to `tests/test_windows_security.py`. The
`windows-latest` job runs these on real local NTFS. Mocks alone do not satisfy
junction/symlink, DACL/owner, lock, concurrent replacement, crash-cleanup, or
atomic-write coverage. Do not add a weaker path-only fallback for Windows;
UNC/network/device/alternate-stream and non-NTFS storage remain explicit
fail-closed boundaries.

The CI pipeline runs quality and strict documentation checks, the unit test
suite against every supported Python version, a full native Windows suite, the
locked frontend and real-browser management E2E, the GreenMail baseline, and a
restricted runtime-container build plus raw stdio/catalog smoke for pull requests
and pushes to `main`. Run `make container-check` locally when changing the
Dockerfile, dependency lock, package contents, entrypoint, or stdio startup; it
requires Docker. CI also builds one release-format wheel/sdist pair and runs
`make verify-dist` against those exact bytes, including the Node-free from-sdist
rebuild and installed/`uvx` UI smokes. Relevant changes should still run
`make test-browser` and `make test-e2e` locally before they are pushed so
failures can be diagnosed without waiting for CI.

After the `Main` workflow succeeds for a push to `main`, the separate
`Standard Container to GHCR` workflow publishes the root `Dockerfile` as
`ghcr.io/yusoofsh/mcp-email-server:standard` and an immutable
`:standard-<commit-sha>` tag. The `remote-ci` workflow publishes the OAuth image
from `Dockerfile.remote` under its existing `latest`, `main`, and `sha-<commit>`
tags; keep the two image variants distinct.

9. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

10. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

# Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.

2. If the pull request adds or changes user-facing functionality, update the relevant page in `docs/`.
   Keep `README.md` focused on the quick-start path.

# Releasing a New Version

This section is for project maintainers.

1. Create an API token on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).
2. Add it to the repository's GitHub Actions secrets as `PYPI_TOKEN`.
3. Create a [GitHub release](https://github.com/Wh1isper/mcp-email-server/releases/new).
4. Create a canonical `X.Y.Z` version tag, optionally prefixed with `v`, as part of the release.

The release tag is the application version authority. The workflow pins and
verifies the peeled release-tag commit, then deterministically stamps its normalized value
into `pyproject.toml` and the matching editable entry in `uv.lock` inside each
isolated release job. It does not rewrite plugin metadata. The complete Python
3.11-3.14 matrix runs against that stamped release tree. A separate unprivileged
validation job rebuilds the locked frontend, rejects staged-asset drift, runs the
default-Python, documentation, browser, packaging, GreenMail, and native
container gates, builds the final wheel and sdist once, and records their
checksums. The credential-bearing Python publish job can only download,
checksum, and publish those unchanged verified artifacts; it contains no build
step. After the same validation gates pass, a separate job with `packages: write`
checks out and stamps the same exact release commit, then publishes Linux
`amd64` and `arm64` images tagged with the normalized release version and
`latest` to `ghcr.io/wh1isper/mcp-email-server`. New packages must be made public
in GitHub Packages so the documented unauthenticated pull path remains valid.

Plugin semver is independent from the Python application. Bump the plugin
manifests and marketplace entry only when the bundled manifests, `.mcp.json`,
skill, or other plugin content changes; application releases selected through
`@latest` do not require a plugin version change.
